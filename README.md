## 📖 A brief history

I started working on this bot in December 2023, I added all the necessary features to make it operational 24/7, which was active until today when I decided to stop the operation and publish my work and tell the experience of what it was like to have a tibia bot farm in 2024, I had 7 chars and 3 pcs, each char farmed an average of 10-11kk a day resulting in an average turnover of 30kk a day, on servers I played I dominated the minocults spot, placing bots on all floors, players gave up farming and dominant guilds didn't care. I hope you make the most of this bot, it's still 100% functional until the day I publish this source.

Below I'll leave some images and videos of how it worked, prints of the bot's UI, and how to install and run it.

## 🎉 🚀 We are thrilled to officially announce PILOTNG REBORN! 🤖✨

After nearly 6 months of intensive testing 🧪 with zero bans 🚫, we are ready to bring to the public a private bot that takes security to the next level.
💎 Our biggest competitive advantage: security and reliability above all else.

🔥 We have refined the single-targeting system and low-level mechanics, ensuring top performance in any situation.

🎯 Initial focus: Tibia Global
🛠️ Future plans: Support for OT-Servers

📜 Fully optimized scripts for the main farming hunts, ready to maximize your results.
⚡ Extremely easy to use: plug-and-play, with clear tutorials and 24/7 support, so any player can set it up and run in just minutes.

💡 Coming soon – we are still in the final testing phase to guarantee maximum stability and efficiency before the official launch.

## 🔴 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

This bot needs good processing power to work properly (fast) i tested it with weak machines and didn't succeed, of the 3 machines i had running bots they all had a ryzen 5 5600 (6 core/12 threads +- 3.5ghz), use an equal or superior processor (or you can also use a worse one but overclock it), in addition to less input detection I chose to use a leonardo arduino to simulate mouse and keyboard inputs, you need a leonardo arduino to use this bot, if you don't have one you can change the source manually to use pyautogui or derivatives, or use a driver, but note that this may result in easier detection, inside the source I will leave a . ino file with the arduino code, just send it to your arduino leonardo and it will work (remember to leave the arduino as the standard COM33 port, otherwise the bot will not work), I also recommend spoofing the arduino (it's not necessary to run the project) so that it doesn't have the id of the arduino board but that of some input device (mouse/keyboard), thus making detection more difficult.

## 🔴 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

THE BOT ONLY WORKS IN 1920X1080 RESOLUTION

TESTED ONLY ON WIN10

- [PYTHON 3.11.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/)
- [POETRY](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [TESSERACT-WINDOWS](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- [VIRTUAL DISPLAY](https://www.amyuni.com/downloads/usbmmidd_v2.zip&v=ybHKFZjSkVY)
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/pt-br/download)

COMMANDS TO ACTIVATE THE VIRTUAL DISPLAY:

- Extract the file, then:

```bash
cd C:\DIRECTORY\OF\EXTRACTED\FOLDER
deviceinstaller64 install usbmmidd.inf usbmmidd
```

-Add virtual display:

```bash
deviceinstaller64 enableidd 1
```

Once you have the second monitor activated, make sure your resolution is 1920x1080, then just open obs, add a game capture, select tibia and remove the pointer, then just open the game capture in windowed mode and click to maximise the window (windowed fullscreen)

OBS: If you have more than one physical screen, switch them all off and stick with just one

🔴 **IMPORTANT** YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE POINTER FROM THE OBS GAME CAPTURE, OTHERWISE IT MAY RESULT IN BUGS

⚠️ **OPTIONAL** IF YOU WANT, SPOOF THE VIRTUAL DISPLAY FOR LESS DETECTION

## 🔴 TIBIA CONFIG REQUIREMENTS

YOU NEED TO USE THIS CONFIGS IN YOUR CLIENT, OTHERWISE WILL NOT WORK
