# is on sys.path here or before importing core.controller is a good practice.
# However, controller.py already adds PROJECT_ROOT (which is XET-SpecterHID) to sys.path.
# So, when `from core.controller import CoreController` is executed,
# the `core/controller.py` script runs, its sys.path modification occurs,
# and then its own internal imports (like `from obs.obs_connector`) will work.
